    "<h1>An Analysis of the 2013 and 2014 Seattle Seahawks</h1>\n",
    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "<p>The Seattle Seahawks won the 2014 superbowl, they beat the Broncos by a hefty 43 to 8. The Seahawks had 13 wins, 3 losses and 0 ties in the 2013 season. Being first in defense and a reasonable 8th in points scored, they were a formidable team. The next year, the Seahawks again made it to the superbowl. However, they lost to the New England Patriots 24 to 28. In the last quarter, there had been some questionable play calling the last time the Seahawks had possession of the ball. One yard from the touchdown line and on second down, Russel Wilson attempted to pass the ball to Ricardo Lockette instead of handing it to \"beast mode\" Marshawn Lynch, who at the time was one of the best running backs in the league. The pass was intercepted by Malcolm Butler, ensuring victory for the Patriots.</p>\n",
